ARGOS EMULATOR VERSION 0.4.0
============================

Argos was finally ported to QEMU version 0.9.1. Please read QEMU's documentation
for details on changes since version 0.8.2 (previously used by Argos).

Additional changes, besides the port, include a double taintness check before 
executing a part of code to ensure attackers' injected code is always detected 
at the moment it is first executed. The check is performed whenever a TB is
is scheduled to be executed, as well as within the translated code whenever EIP
is modified. This is to cover TB chaining performed by QEMU to speed up
emulation. In the future we might consider disabling chaining, if a single check
offers a significant performance gain.
