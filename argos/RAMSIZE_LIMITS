ARGOS EMULATED RAM SIZE LIMITATIONS
===================================
The maximum size of emulated RAM has been set to avoid situations, where we hit
the Linux process maximum virtual memory barrier, and Argos has to exit.

The limits has been set to incorporate the size of data that are need, or could
be required for the smooth operation of Argos.

When not running in net tracker mode, we require an extra byte for each byte of
RAM. This means that we can safely emulate up to 1.25G of RAM.

On the other hand net tracker mode requires 4 bytes for each byte of RAM (the
index of the byte within the network trace is stored). This forces the limit to
be set to 512M of RAM. Even though lowmem mode can be used to dynamically
allocate the needed memory, the guest OS should be able to allocate 5 times the
size of RAM at any time or it will exit.

The only reasonable solution to this problem was to introduce these limits. In
the future, we might look into new methods to limit memory usage with reasonable
performance penalties.
